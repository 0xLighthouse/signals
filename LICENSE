# Ethereum General Public License (EGPL) v1.5

License text copyright © 2025 [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouse.cx). All rights reserved.

## Parameters

**Licensor:** Lighthouse Labs

**Licensed Work:** Signals Protocol
The Licensed Work is © 2025 Lighthouse Labs

**Additional Use Grant:** None

**Transition Date:** the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of this version

**Transition License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

**Ethereum Network:** Ethereum mainnet (Chain ID 1)

**Ethereum-Aligned:** Any L2, rollup, or chain that settles to Ethereum mainnet and contributes ETH fees or security to the Ethereum Network

## Core Terms

The Licensor grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work for any purpose.

Before the Transition Date, production use is permitted only:

- By the Licensor;
- By parties explicitly authorized in writing by the Licensor;
- As specified in the Additional Use Grant above; or
- Under a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

On the Transition Date, the Licensed Work automatically becomes available under the Transition License. Additionally, production use on the Ethereum Network and Ethereum-Aligned Networks becomes freely permitted (subject to copyleft requirements in Section 3).

At all times (before and after the Transition Date), production use on Non-Aligned Networks (EVM chains that do not settle to or contribute fees to Ethereum) requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

All copies and derivative works must retain this License. If you deploy the Licensed Work where third parties can interact with it over a network, you must make the complete source code available under this License.

Any use in violation of this License automatically terminates your rights for all versions of the Licensed Work.

This License does not grant rights to trademarks, logos, or tokens associated with the Licensor or Ethereum.

**TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE LICENSED WORK.**

## Detailed Provisions

### 1. Definitions

**"Licensed Work"** means the software (source code and object code) and documentation specified in the Parameters section above, made available under this License.

**"Licensor"** means the copyright holder specified in the Parameters section.

**"Ethereum Network"** means the public Ethereum mainnet blockchain specified in the Parameters section (typically Chain ID 1), which uses Ether (ETH) for gas fees and operates via proof-of-stake consensus.

**"Ethereum-Aligned Network"** means any layer-2 network, rollup, sidechain, or blockchain that regularly settles transactions or data to the Ethereum Network and thereby contributes fees or security to Ethereum. This includes optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, validiums, and other L2s that post data to Ethereum and pay ETH gas fees through calldata, blob space, or other mechanisms. It also includes chains that stake ETH or otherwise contribute to Ethereum's economic security.

**"Non-Aligned Network"** means any blockchain or distributed ledger that is EVM-compatible with, derived from, or interoperable with Ethereum or the Licensed Work, but does not qualify as an Ethereum-Aligned Network because it does not settle to or contribute fees/security to the Ethereum Network. Examples include independent EVM chains, alternative L1s, and sidechains that do not post data to Ethereum mainnet.

**"Production Use"** means any use of the Licensed Work to:

- Provide services to third parties
- Validate or execute transactions on a public network
- Operate publicly accessible infrastructure
- Generate revenue or operate in a live commercial environment
- Deploy smart contracts, validators, nodes, or applications that external parties interact with or rely upon

**Non-Production Use** includes internal testing, development, security auditing, academic research, or experimentation not made available to third parties and not used for revenue generation.

**"Transition Date"** means the date specified in the Parameters section, or if none is specified, the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of this specific version of the Licensed Work. Each version may have its own Transition Date, which may be updated by the Licensor to an earlier date but not a later date beyond four years from initial release.

**"Transition License"** means the license specified in the Parameters section (typically AGPL-3.0-or-later) that will govern the Licensed Work on and after the Transition Date.

**"Additional Use Grant"** means any specific production uses explicitly permitted before the Transition Date, as defined in the Parameters section or in a separate document referenced therein.

### 2. Grant of Rights

#### 2.1 Non-Production Rights

Subject to compliance with this License, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work in any environment or on any network.

#### 2.2 Production Use Before Transition Date

Before the Transition Date, Production Use of the Licensed Work is permitted only if you meet one of the following conditions:

- You are the Licensor; or
- You have written authorization from the Licensor explicitly granting you Production Use rights; or
- Your use falls within the Additional Use Grant specified in the Parameters section; or
- You have obtained a commercial license from the Licensor for such Production Use.

Any Production Use not meeting these conditions before the Transition Date is prohibited and constitutes a material breach of this License.

#### 2.3 Additional Use Grant Mechanism

The Licensor may specify an Additional Use Grant in the Parameters section to permit certain limited production uses before the Transition Date without requiring individual authorization. Such grants might include:

- Non-commercial production use on Ethereum mainnet or aligned networks
- Production use by specified categories of users (e.g., researchers, non-profits)
- Beta testing by approved testers
- Use by ecosystem partners or grant recipients
- Other uses defined at a URL, ENS name, or in a separate document

If the Additional Use Grant field states "None," no additional production uses are permitted beyond those authorized directly by the Licensor.

#### 2.4 Rights Upon Transition Date

Effective on the Transition Date:

- **Transition License Applies:** The Licensed Work becomes available under the Transition License specified in the Parameters section, and you may exercise all rights granted by that license.
- **Ethereum-Aligned Production Use:** You may make Production Use of the Licensed Work on the Ethereum Network and Ethereum-Aligned Networks without restriction, royalty, or commercial license, subject to the copyleft requirements in Section 3.
- **Prior Restrictions Lifted:** The early-stage production restrictions in Section 2.2 no longer apply, except as noted in Section 2.5.

#### 2.5 Non-Aligned Network Restriction (Permanent)

At all times, both before and after the Transition Date, Production Use on Non-Aligned Networks requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

The Transition Date conversion does not grant rights to deploy the Licensed Work on Non-Aligned Networks. Such use requires explicit commercial licensing regardless of when it occurs.

#### 2.6 Version-Specific Licensing

This License applies separately to each version of the Licensed Work released by the Licensor. Different versions may have different Transition Dates, Additional Use Grants, or other terms as specified in their respective Parameters sections. The Transition Date for one version does not affect the license terms for other versions.

### 3. Copyleft and Source Code Requirements

#### 3.1 License Preservation

All copies, modifications, and derivative works of the Licensed Work must be distributed under this License (before the Transition Date) or the Transition License (after the Transition Date). You must retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices present in the Licensed Work.

#### 3.2 Network Use as Distribution

Making the Licensed Work available for third parties to interact with over a network constitutes distribution under this License, even if no copy is directly transferred. This includes deploying smart contracts, operating blockchain nodes, running validators, or providing network services based on the Licensed Work.

#### 3.3 Source Code Disclosure

Whenever you distribute or deploy the Licensed Work (including through network deployment), you must make the complete corresponding source code available to all users/recipients under this License's terms. The source code must be:

- **Complete:** Include all source files, build scripts, configuration, and dependencies needed to compile and run the software
- **Accessible:** Published in a readily accessible location (e.g., public repository)
- **Timely:** Available simultaneously with or before the deployment
- **Unobfuscated:** Not protected by technical measures that prevent study or modification
- **Under This License:** Available under EGPL terms (before Transition Date) or Transition License terms (after Transition Date)

Failure to provide source code as required is a material breach resulting in immediate license termination.

#### 3.4 Modifications and Derivative Works

Any modifications or derivative works you create must also be licensed under this License (or the Transition License after the Transition Date). You may not distribute or deploy modified versions under proprietary or incompatible terms.

You are encouraged (though not required before the Transition Date) to contribute improvements back to the original project or the Ethereum community.

### 4. Transition Date and License Transition

#### 4.1 Automatic Conversion

On the Transition Date specified in the Parameters section, the Licensed Work automatically becomes available under the Transition License. From that date forward, the Transition License governs use of the Licensed Work, and the production restrictions in Section 2.2 cease to apply.

The Non-Aligned Network restriction in Section 2.5 persists as a separate commercial licensing arrangement at the Licensor's discretion.

#### 4.2 No Retroactive Effect

Conversion to the Transition License does not retroactively excuse violations that occurred before the Transition Date. The Licensor retains all rights to pursue remedies for prior breaches.

#### 4.3 Earlier Transition Date

The Licensor may specify an earlier Transition Date at any time by updating the Parameters section or publishing a notice at a referenced URL/ENS name. The Licensor cannot extend the Transition Date beyond four years from initial release.

### 5. Patent Grant

#### 5.1 License Grant

The Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license under the Licensor's patent claims that are necessarily infringed by using or modifying the Licensed Work as permitted by this License.

#### 5.2 Patent Retaliation

If you initiate patent litigation against the Licensor, any contributor to the Licensed Work, or any user of the Licensed Work alleging that the Licensed Work infringes your patents, all patent licenses granted to you under this License immediately terminate.

### 6. Termination

#### 6.1 Automatic Termination

Your rights under this License automatically terminate immediately if you:

- Make Production Use before the Transition Date without authorization (Section 2.2)
- Deploy on a Non-Aligned Network without a commercial license (Section 2.5)
- Fail to provide source code as required (Section 3.3)
- Violate any other material term of this License

Termination applies to all versions of the Licensed Work licensed to you.

#### 6.2 No Cure Period

Terminated rights are not automatically restored. Restoration requires explicit written reinstatement from the Licensor. Ceasing the violation does not restore your rights.

#### 6.3 Downstream Recipients

Your termination does not affect rights of downstream recipients who are in compliance with the License, as they receive their license directly from the Licensor.

### 7. Warranty Disclaimer

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND TITLE.

You use the Licensed Work at your own risk and are solely responsible for determining its appropriateness for your purposes.

### 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES) ARISING FROM THIS LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED WORK, even if advised of possible damages.

This includes but is not limited to: loss of profits, data, funds, tokens, or digital assets; business interruption; security vulnerabilities; or regulatory consequences.

Some jurisdictions do not allow liability exclusions; in such cases, liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Licensor and contributors from all claims, damages, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from:

- Your use, modification, or distribution of the Licensed Work
- Your violation of this License
- Your violation of third-party rights

### 10. Miscellaneous

#### 10.1 No Trademark Rights

This License does not grant rights to use trademarks, logos, or brand names of the Licensor or Ethereum Foundation. You may not imply endorsement by the Licensor or Ethereum community.

This License does not grant rights to any tokens or cryptocurrencies associated with the Licensed Work or Ethereum.

#### 10.2 No Sublicensing

You may not sublicense the Licensed Work. Recipients receive their license directly from the Licensor under this License's terms.

#### 10.3 Entire Agreement

This License (together with any commercial license you obtain) constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Licensed Work.

#### 10.4 Severability

If any provision is unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary, and all other provisions remain in effect.

#### 10.5 No Waiver

Failure to enforce any provision does not waive future enforcement rights. Waivers must be in writing signed by the Licensor.

#### 10.6 Governing Law

This License is governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction] without regard to conflicts of law principles. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts of [Jurisdiction].

#### 10.7 Export Compliance

You are responsible for complying with all export laws and regulations. You represent that you are not in a jurisdiction where export is prohibited.

#### 10.8 Conspicuous Display

You must conspicuously display this License on each original or modified copy of the Licensed Work. If you receive the Licensed Work from a third party, this License applies to your use of that work.

#### 10.9 License Text Reuse

Others may use this License text for their own works, provided they:

- Do not alter the substantive terms, Ethereum-alignment provisions, or copyleft requirements
- Replace Parameters section placeholders with their own details
- Specify an OSI-approved Transition License and a Transition Date within four years
- Only call it "EGPL v1.4" if substantively identical to this text

## Covenants of Licensor

In consideration of the right to use the "Ethereum General Public License" name and this License text, Licensor covenants to all recipients of the Licensed Work:

- To specify as the Transition License either AGPL-3.0-or-later or another OSI-approved license compatible with AGPL v3, where "compatible" means software under the Transition License can be combined with software under AGPL v3 or later versions.
- To either: (a) specify an Additional Use Grant that does not impose restrictions beyond this License, or (b) specify "None" if no additional production uses are granted before the Transition Date.
- To specify a Transition Date within four years of initial release.
- Not to modify the substantive protections, requirements, or structure of this License in ways that would defeat its purpose of protecting Ethereum alignment while ensuring eventual open-source release.

## Notice

The Ethereum General Public License (this document, or the "License") is not an Open Source license as defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) during its initial term before the Transition Date. However, the Licensed Work will automatically become available under an Open Source license (the Transition License) on the Transition Date, as stated in this License.

This License is designed to protect software development for the Ethereum ecosystem from parasitic use and commercial extraction by non-aligned chains, while ensuring the software eventually enters the open commons for all to use freely.
