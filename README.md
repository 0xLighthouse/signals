# üì° Signals

A protocol for surfacing and prioritizing community objectives

> We will be at the `d/acc` [residency](https://x.com/LighthouseGov/status/1973754291744886846) in Patagonia! üèîÔ∏èhosted by [Protocol Labs](https://github.com/protocol) and running some field tests. Please reach out if you will be there!

## Intoduction

Signals is a new coordination protocol for decentralized communities.
It enables participants to lock governance tokens behind initiatives they believe in, surfacing real-time sentiment and collective intent before formal governance or funding decisions take place.

Signals lets communities explore ideas fluidly, observe where alignment emerges, and experiment with incentive-aligned decision discovery.

You can learn more about the mechanics here:

- Primer, <https://mirror.xyz/lighthousegov.eth/yOY3vgiiE5HfPbUNLSbYUpjICDA3SrcJkQVEjTPiQR4>
- Incentive Design, <https://mirror.xyz/lighthousegov.eth/mEZhb9Nwav_ZpwrvOAKCxzmJFbsez-jow9t2b4mjc2k>

## Why Signals?

Existing on-chain governance systems are slow, intimidating, and dominated by whales.

Signals was designed to address these challenges:

- **Continuous discovery** ‚Äî surface ideas early, before proposal lock-in
- **Conviction signaling** ‚Äî longer token locks carry more weight
- **Fairness** ‚Äî small holders can match whale influence through time commitment
- **Pre-vote feedback** ‚Äî measure support dynamics before governance execution
- **Optional incentives** ‚Äî allow sponsors to reward aligned participation

Signals helps communities listen to themselves ‚Äî revealing which directions have genuine collective energy.

### Edge City Claim (optional)

To enable the Edge City residency claim flow in the interface:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDGE_CITY=true`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDGE_CITY_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...` (newly deployed `ExperimentToken`)
- `EDGE_OS_API_KEY=...` and optionally `EDGE_OS_BASE_URL=https://api-citizen-portal.simplefi.tech`
- `EDGE_CITY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...` (server-side key used to sign claim allowances)
- `EDGE_CITY_DEFAULT_CLAIM_AMOUNT_WEI=1000000000000000000`
- `EDGE_CITY_AMOUNT_PER_DAY_WEI=...` (optional; overrides default amount when residency days are present)
- `EDGE_CITY_ALLOWANCE_TTL_SECONDS=86400` (optional; defaults to 24 hours)

Flow overview:

1. The user authenticates with EdgeOS; the server validates residency (email verification plus popup/total-day rules).
2. The server signs an EIP-712 allowance tying together the wallet, participant ID, amount, and expiry and returns it to the client.
3. The UI submits `claim(address to, uint256 participantId, uint256 amount, uint256 deadline, bytes signature)` on the `ExperimentToken`.

EIP-712 domain: `name = "ExperimentToken"`, `version = "1"`, `chainId`, `verifyingContract = token address`.
Struct type:

```
Claim(address to,uint256 participantId,uint256 amount,uint256 deadline)
```

Keep the allowance signer key secure; rotate it by calling `setAllowanceSigner` on-chain and updating `EDGE_CITY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY`.
Short TTLs reduce the blast radius if an access token leaks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Deploy a Board**
   - Any community can deploy a board via the Signals factory.
   - Configure parameters:
     - Governance token (ERC20)
     - Max initiatives & duration
     - Acceptance threshold
     - Minimum tokens to propose
     - Decay style (linear / exponential)

2. **Propose Initiatives**
   - Participants propose initiatives (drafts, ideas, or full proposals).
   - Each includes metadata (title, markdown body, optional attachments).

3. **Signal Support**
   - Members lock tokens in support of initiatives.
   - Weight = amount √ó lock duration √ó decay factor.
   - Locks cannot be withdrawn until expiration or acceptance.

4. **Acceptance & Refunds**
   - Once support passes the threshold, the initiative is accepted.
   - Supporters are refunded their tokens automatically.

5. **Incentives (Optional)**
   - Anyone can escrow rewards (e.g., USDC) for an initiative.
   - If the initiative is accepted, rewards distribute proportionally to supporters.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Board** | A configured governance surface for a token community |
