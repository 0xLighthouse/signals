# Initiative Interactions Reference

This section provides comprehensive technical documentation for interacting with initiatives in the Signals protocol. Each function reference includes signatures, parameters, validation rules, events, errors, and integration examples.

## Function Categories

### Core Initiative Functions

**[Proposing Initiatives](/reference/initiative-functions/propose-initiative)**
- `proposeInitiative()` - Create a new initiative
- `proposeInitiativeWithLock()` - Create an initiative and immediately lock tokens

**[Supporting Initiatives](/reference/initiative-functions/support-initiative)**
- `supportInitiative()` - Lock tokens to signal support for an initiative

**[Redeeming Locks](/reference/initiative-functions/redeem)**
- `redeem()` - Withdraw locked tokens after initiative acceptance or expiration

### Owner Functions

**[Accepting Initiatives](/reference/initiative-functions/accept-initiative)**
- `acceptInitiative()` - Officially approve an initiative (owner only)

**[Expiring Initiatives](/reference/initiative-functions/expire-initiative)**
- `expireInitiative()` - Terminate inactive initiatives (owner only)

### Bounties

**[Adding Bounties](/reference/initiative-functions/add-bounty)**
- `addBounty()` - Contribute external token rewards to initiatives
- TokenRegistry functions for managing whitelisted tokens
- Distribution configuration and versioning

### Tracking & Queries

**[Tracking Functions](/reference/initiative-functions/tracking-functions)**
- Weight queries (current and historical)
- Lock position queries
- Supporter enumeration
- ERC721 position management
- Configuration queries

## Quick Reference

### For Initiative Proposers

```solidity
// Check eligibility
bool canPropose = signals.canPropose(msg.sender)

ISignals.Attachment[] memory attachments = new ISignals.Attachment[](0);

// Create initiative
signals.proposeInitiative(title, body, attachments)

// Or create with initial support
uint256 tokenId = signals.proposeInitiativeWithLock(
    title,
    body,
    amount,
    lockDuration,
    attachments
)
```

### For Supporters

```solidity
// Check eligibility
bool canParticipate = signals.canParticipate(msg.sender)

// Support an initiative
uint256 tokenId = signals.supportInitiative(
    initiativeId,
    amount,
    lockDuration
)

// Later: Redeem after acceptance/expiration
signals.redeem(tokenId)
```

### For Board Owners

```solidity
// Accept an initiative
signals.acceptInitiative(initiativeId)

// Or expire an inactive initiative
signals.expireInitiative(initiativeId)
```

### For Bounty Contributors

```solidity
// Add a bounty to an initiative
token.approve(address(bounties), amount)
bounties.addBounty(
    initiativeId,
    address(token),
    amount,
    expiresAt,
    IBounties.Conditions.NONE
)
```

### For Tracking Support

```solidity
// Get initiative details
Initiative memory init = signals.getInitiative(initiativeId)

// Get current weight
uint256 weight = signals.getWeight(initiativeId)

// Get all supporters
address[] memory supporters = signals.getSupporters(initiativeId)

// Get your lock positions
uint256[] memory myLocks = signals.listPositions(msg.sender)
```

## Common Data Structures

### Initiative

```solidity
struct Initiative {
    string title;
    string body;
    InitiativeState state;
    address proposer;
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 lastActivity;
    uint256 underlyingLocked;
    uint256 acceptanceTimestamp;
}
```

### TokenLock

```solidity
struct TokenLock {
    uint256 initiativeId;
    uint256 tokenAmount;
    uint256 lockDuration;
    uint256 created;
    bool withdrawn;
}
```

### Initiative States

```solidity
enum InitiativeState {
    Proposed,    // Initial state, can receive support
    Accepted,    // Board owner accepted the initiative
    Cancelled,   // Reserved for future use
    Expired      // No activity for > activityTimeout
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Frontend Integration

See individual function pages for detailed TypeScript examples. Common patterns include:

- Checking eligibility before transactions
- Querying weight and progress
- Listing user positions
- Calculating historical data for charts
- Monitoring events for real-time updates

### Contract Integration

For contracts integrating with Signals:

- Implement `ISignalsLock` interface for compatibility
- Use weight queries for governance decisions
- Subscribe to events for state changes
- Query lock positions for reward calculations
