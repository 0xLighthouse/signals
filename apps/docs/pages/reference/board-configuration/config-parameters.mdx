# Board Configuration

## Configuration Structure

The complete configuration is defined in the `FactoryDeployment` struct:

```solidity
struct FactoryDeployment {
    address owner;                                      // Board owner address
    address underlyingToken;                           // ERC20 token address
    uint256 acceptanceThreshold;                       // Weight needed for acceptance
    uint256 lockInterval;                              // Time unit for locks (seconds)
    uint256 maxLockIntervals;                          // Max lock duration in intervals
    uint256 proposalCap;                               // Max active proposals
    uint256 decayCurveType;                           // 0=linear, 1=exponential
    uint256[] decayCurveParameters;                    // Curve params (must be length 1)
    ProposerRequirements proposerRequirements;         // Who can propose
    ParticipantRequirements participantRequirements;   // Who can support
    uint256 releaseLockDuration;                       // Timelock after acceptance
    uint256 boardOpensAt;                             // Unix timestamp for opening
    BoardIncentives boardIncentives;                   // Reward configuration
}
```

## Core Parameters

### owner

- **Type:** `address`
- **Purpose:** Address that controls the board (can accept initiatives, close board, etc.)
- **Requirement:** Must not be `address(0)` (i.e. ownerless boards are not allowed)
- **Suggestion:** Use a multisig or DAO-controlled address for trustless operation

### underlyingToken

- **Type:** `address`
- **Purpose:** The token used for signaling and voting weight
- **Requirement:** Must be a valid ERC20 token address
- **Token Types:**
  - Standard ERC20: Works with all eligibility types except `MinBalanceAndDuration`
  - ERC20Votes: Required for `MinBalanceAndDuration` eligibility (checkpoint support)

### acceptanceThreshold

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** Total weight an initiative must reach to be eligible for actioning the initiative
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### lockInterval

- **Type:** `uint256` (seconds)
- **Purpose:** Time unit for lock durations and decay calculations
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### maxLockIntervals

- **Type:** `uint256` (number of intervals)
- **Purpose:** Maximum duration users can lock tokens, represented as a number of intervals 
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0
- **Note:** For example, if `lockInterval` is set to 86400 (1 day), then a `maxLockIntervals` of 365 would allow for a maximum lock duration of 365 days

### proposalCap

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** Maximum number of active proposals allowed on the board
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### decayCurveType

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** How weight decays over time
- **Requirement:** Must be a valid option (currenlty only 2 types are supported):
- **Options:**
  - `0` - Linear decay: Weight decreases steadily
  - `1` - Exponential decay: Weight decreases at accelerating rate

### decayCurveParameters

- **Type:** `uint256[]`
- **Purpose:** Parameters for the decay curve
- **Requirement:** Array length must match what is expected based on the chosen decay curve type
- **Linear Decay (Type 0):**
  - Parameter: Decay rate (1e18 = 1:1 linear)
- **Exponential Decay (Type 1):**
  - Parameter: Decay multiplier per interval

### releaseLockDuration

- **Type:** `uint256` (seconds)
- **Purpose:** Additional timelock after initiative acceptance before tokens can be redeemed
- **Values:**
  - `0` - Immediate release
  - `7 days` (604800) - 1 week cooldown
  - `30 days` (2592000) - 1 month vesting

### boardOpenAt

- **Type:** `uint256` (Unix timestamp)
- **Purpose:** Fair launch mechanism - board doesn't accept proposals until this time
- **Values:**
  - `0` - Opens immediately
  - `block.timestamp + 1 hours` - Opens 1 hour from deployment
  - Specific timestamp for scheduled launch
