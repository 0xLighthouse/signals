# Board Configuration

## Eligibility Requirements

### ProposerRequirements

Defines who can create initiatives:

```solidity
struct ProposerRequirements {
    EligibilityType eligibilityType;  // None, MinBalance, or MinBalanceAndDuration
    uint256 minBalance;               // Min tokens to hold (if applicable)
    uint256 minHoldingDuration;       // Min blocks to hold (if applicable)
    uint256 threshold;                // Tokens proposer must lock when proposing
}
```

#### EligibilityType.None (Most Permissive)

Anyone can propose if they have the threshold:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
    minBalance: 0,
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 50_000 * 1e18  // Must lock 50k tokens to propose
})
```

**Validations:**
- `threshold` must be > 0

#### EligibilityType.MinBalance

Proposers must hold a minimum balance:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalance,
    minBalance: 75_000 * 1e18,    // Must hold 75k tokens
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 50_000 * 1e18      // Plus 50k to lock when proposing
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `threshold` is additional amount to lock

#### EligibilityType.MinBalanceAndDuration (Most Restrictive)

Proposers must hold tokens for a minimum duration:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalanceAndDuration,
    minBalance: 100_000 * 1e18,
    minHoldingDuration: 50400,    // blocks (~7 days at 12s/block)
    threshold: 100_000 * 1e18
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `minHoldingDuration` must be > 0

- **Requires ERC20Votes tokens** - Must implement the `IVotes` interface with checkpoint functionality

### ParticipantRequirements

Defines who can support initiatives:

```solidity
struct ParticipantRequirements {
    uint256 minBalance;         // User must hold this many tokens right now
    uint256 minHoldingDuration; // User must have held tokens for this duration (requires ERC20Votes)
    uint256 minLockAmount;      // Min tokens to lock when supporting (must be ≤ minBalance)
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- **minBalance**: User must currently hold this many tokens to be eligible to support
- **minHoldingDuration**: User must have held ≥ minBalance tokens for this many blocks in the past. Only works with ERC20Votes tokens that support checkpoints.
- **minLockAmount**: Minimum amount user must lock when supporting. Must be equal to or less than minBalance.

**Eligibility Patterns** (inferred from field values):

#### No Requirements (Most Permissive)
Anyone can support with any amount:

```solidity
ParticipantRequirements({
    minBalance: 0,
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    minLockAmount: 0
})
```

#### Balance Requirement Only
Users must hold a minimum balance:

```solidity
ParticipantRequirements({
    minBalance: 10_000 * 1e18,    // Must hold 10k tokens
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    minLockAmount: 1_000 * 1e18   // Must lock at least 1k tokens
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `minLockAmount` must be ≤ minBalance

#### Balance + Duration Requirement (Most Restrictive)
Users must have held tokens for a minimum duration:

```solidity
ParticipantRequirements({
    minBalance: 10_000 * 1e18,
    minHoldingDuration: 50400,    // blocks (~7 days at 12s/block)
    minLockAmount: 1_000 * 1e18
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `minHoldingDuration` must be > 0
- `minLockAmount` must be ≤ minBalance
- **Requires ERC20Votes tokens** - Must implement the `IVotes` interface with checkpoint functionality
