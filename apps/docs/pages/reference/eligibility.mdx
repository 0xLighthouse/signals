### Eligibility Types

Eligibility types need to be specified for `ProposerRequirements` and `

#### None

No restrictions - anyone with sufficient tokens to meet the `threshold` can propose initiatives.

**Use case:** Open, permissionless boards where you want maximum participation.

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
    minBalance: 0,
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 1_000 * 1e18  // Amount locked when proposing
})
```

#### MinBalance

Users must hold a minimum token balance to propose initiatives. The balance check happens at the time of proposal.

**Use case:** Boards that want to ensure proposers have skin in the game.

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalance,
    minBalance: 10_000 * 1e18,  // 10,000 tokens
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 1_000 * 1e18
})
```

**Notes:**

* Works with any ERC20 token
* Balance check is separate from `threshold` (the amount locked)
