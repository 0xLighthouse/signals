# Creating a Signals Board

A Signals board can be created around a specific theme or purpose, allowing participants to submit initiatives in line with the chosen objective. The board will have an owner who has additional rights and responsibilities to administer the board. It is possible for a DAO to enact ownership functions as the result of a DAO vote, enabling decentralized and permissionless operation of the board.

The board is first deployed via the `SignalsFactory` contract, and additional configurations can be applied later. 

## Factory Deployment

Boards are created through the `SignalsFactory` contract:

```solidity
function create(ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment calldata config)
    external
    payable
    returns (address)
```

### Returns

- `address` - The deployed Signals board contract address

### Event Emitted

```solidity
event BoardCreated(address indexed board, address indexed owner)
```

## Configuration Structure

The complete configuration is defined in the `FactoryDeployment` struct:

```solidity
struct FactoryDeployment {
    address owner;                                      // Board owner address
    address underlyingToken;                           // ERC20 token address
    uint256 acceptanceThreshold;                       // Weight needed for acceptance
    uint256 lockInterval;                              // Time unit for locks (seconds)
    uint256 maxLockIntervals;                          // Max lock duration in intervals
    uint256 proposalCap;                               // Max active proposals
    uint256 decayCurveType;                           // 0=linear, 1=exponential
    uint256[] decayCurveParameters;                    // Curve params (must be length 1)
    ProposerRequirements proposerRequirements;         // Who can propose
    ParticipantRequirements participantRequirements;   // Who can support
    uint256 releaseLockDuration;                       // Timelock after acceptance
    uint256 boardOpensAt;                             // Unix timestamp for opening
    BoardIncentives boardIncentives;                   // Reward configuration
}
```

## Core Parameters

### owner

- **Type:** `address`
- **Purpose:** Address that controls the board (can accept initiatives, close board, etc.)
- **Requirement:** Must not be `address(0)` (i.e. ownerless boards are not allowed)
- **Suggestion:** Use a multisig or DAO-controlled address for trustless operation

### underlyingToken

- **Type:** `address`
- **Purpose:** The token used for signaling and voting weight
- **Requirement:** Must be a valid ERC20 token address
- **Token Types:**
  - Standard ERC20: Works with all eligibility types except `MinBalanceAndDuration`
  - ERC20Votes: Required for `MinBalanceAndDuration` eligibility (checkpoint support)

### acceptanceThreshold

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** Total weight an initiative must reach to be eligible for actioning the initiative
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### lockInterval

- **Type:** `uint256` (seconds)
- **Purpose:** Time unit for lock durations and decay calculations
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### maxLockIntervals

- **Type:** `uint256` (number of intervals)
- **Purpose:** Maximum duration users can lock tokens, represented as a number of intervals 
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0
- **Note:** For example, if `lockInterval` is set to 86400 (1 day), then a `maxLockIntervals` of 365 would allow for a maximum lock duration of 365 days

### proposalCap

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** Maximum number of active proposals allowed on the board
- **Requirement:** Must be > 0

### decayCurveType

- **Type:** `uint256`
- **Purpose:** How weight decays over time
- **Requirement:** Must be a valid option (currenlty only 2 types are supported):
- **Options:**
  - `0` - Linear decay: Weight decreases steadily
  - `1` - Exponential decay: Weight decreases at accelerating rate

### decayCurveParameters

- **Type:** `uint256[]`
- **Purpose:** Parameters for the decay curve
- **Requirement:** Array length must match what is expected based on the chosen decay curve type
- **Linear Decay (Type 0):**
  - Parameter: Decay rate (1e18 = 1:1 linear)
- **Exponential Decay (Type 1):**
  - Parameter: Decay multiplier per interval

### releaseLockDuration

- **Type:** `uint256` (seconds)
- **Purpose:** Additional timelock after initiative acceptance before tokens can be redeemed
- **Values:**
  - `0` - Immediate release
  - `7 days` (604800) - 1 week cooldown
  - `30 days` (2592000) - 1 month vesting

### boardOpensAt

- **Type:** `uint256` (Unix timestamp)
- **Purpose:** Fair launch mechanism - board doesn't accept proposals until this time
- **Values:**
  - `0` - Opens immediately
  - `block.timestamp + 1 hours` - Opens 1 hour from deployment
  - Specific timestamp for scheduled launch

## Eligibility Requirements

### ProposerRequirements

Defines who can create initiatives:

```solidity
struct ProposerRequirements {
    EligibilityType eligibilityType;  // None, MinBalance, or MinBalanceAndDuration
    uint256 minBalance;               // Min tokens to hold (if applicable)
    uint256 minHoldingDuration;       // Min blocks to hold (if applicable)
    uint256 threshold;                // Tokens proposer must lock when proposing
}
```

#### EligibilityType.None (Most Permissive)

Anyone can propose if they have the threshold:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
    minBalance: 0,
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 50_000 * 1e18  // Must lock 50k tokens to propose
})
```

**Validations:**
- `threshold` must be > 0

#### EligibilityType.MinBalance

Proposers must hold a minimum balance:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalance,
    minBalance: 75_000 * 1e18,    // Must hold 75k tokens
    minHoldingDuration: 0,
    threshold: 50_000 * 1e18      // Plus 50k to lock when proposing
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `threshold` is additional amount to lock

#### EligibilityType.MinBalanceAndDuration (Most Restrictive)

Proposers must hold tokens for a minimum duration:

```solidity
ProposerRequirements({
    eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalanceAndDuration,
    minBalance: 100_000 * 1e18,
    minHoldingDuration: 50400,    // blocks (~7 days at 12s/block)
    threshold: 100_000 * 1e18
})
```

**Validations:**
- `minBalance` must be > 0
- `minHoldingDuration` must be > 0
- **Token must support ERC20Votes** (checkpoint functionality)

### ParticipantRequirements

Defines who can support initiatives:

```solidity
struct ParticipantRequirements {
    EligibilityType eligibilityType;  // None, MinBalance, or MinBalanceAndDuration
    uint256 minBalance;               // Min tokens to hold (if applicable)
    uint256 minHoldingDuration;       // Min blocks to hold (if applicable)
}
```

Same eligibility types as proposers, but no threshold (participants choose lock amount).

**Validations:**
- If `MinBalance`: `minBalance` must be > 0
- If `MinBalanceAndDuration`: `minBalance` and `minHoldingDuration` must be > 0, requires ERC20Votes token

## Incentives Configuration

Optional reward system for early supporters:

```solidity
struct BoardIncentives {
    bool enabled;               // Whether incentives are active
    uint256 curveType;         // 0 = linear decay
    uint256[] curveParameters; // Parameters for incentive curve
}
```

### Incentives Setup

If `enabled == true`, you must separately:

1. **Deploy IncentivesPool:**
   ```solidity
   IncentivesPool pool = new IncentivesPool()
   ```

2. **Initialize Pool:**
   ```solidity
   rewardToken.approve(address(pool), totalRewards)
   pool.initializePool(
       address(rewardToken),
       totalRewards,           // e.g., 1_000_000 * 1e18
       maxPerInitiative        // e.g., 10_000 * 1e18
   )
   ```

3. **Approve Board:**
   ```solidity
   pool.approveBoard(address(signalsBoard))
   ```

4. **Link to Board (before opening):**
   ```solidity
   signalsBoard.setIncentivesPool(address(pool))
   ```

**Important:** `setIncentivesPool()` can only be called BEFORE `boardOpensAt` timestamp.

**Incentive Mechanics:**
- Early supporters (closer to board open time) get more rewards
- Uses linear decay curve with parameter `k` (e.g., `[0.12e18]` = 12% decay rate)
- Rewards auto-claim on `redeem()` or manual claim
- Pool depletion doesn't block acceptance

## Configuration Examples

### Minimal (Testing)

```solidity
uint256[] memory decayParams = new uint256[](1)
decayParams[0] = 1e18

ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment({
    owner: deployer,
    underlyingToken: tokenAddress,
    acceptanceThreshold: 1,
    maxLockIntervals: 1,
    proposalCap: 1,
    lockInterval: 1,
    decayCurveType: 0,
    decayCurveParameters: decayParams,
    proposerRequirements: ProposerRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,
        minHoldingDuration: 0,
        threshold: 1
    }),
    participantRequirements: ParticipantRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,

})
```

### Standard Production

```solidity
uint256[] memory decayParams = new uint256[](1)
decayParams[0] = 9e17 // 0.9 linear decay

ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment({
    owner: daoMultisig,
    underlyingToken: governanceToken,
    acceptanceThreshold: 500_000 * 1e18,      // 500k tokens
    maxLockIntervals: 365,                     // 1 year max lock
    proposalCap: 20,                          // 20 concurrent proposals
    lockInterval: 1 days,                      // Daily intervals
    decayCurveType: 0,                        // Linear decay
    decayCurveParameters: decayParams,
    proposerRequirements: ProposerRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalance,
        minBalance: 10_000 * 1e18,            // Must hold 10k tokens
        minHoldingDuration: 0,
        threshold: 50_000 * 1e18              // Must lock 50k to propose
    }),
    participantRequirements: ParticipantRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,
        minHoldingDuration: 0
    }),
    releaseLockDuration: 0,                   // Immediate release
    boardOpensAt: 0,                          // Open immediately
    boardIncentives: BoardIncentives({
        enabled: false,
        curveType: 0,
        curveParameters: new uint256[](0)
    })
})
```

### High Security (Sybil-Resistant)

```solidity
uint256[] memory decayParams = new uint256[](1)
decayParams[0] = 9e17

ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment({
    owner: daoMultisig,
    underlyingToken: votesToken,              // Must be ERC20Votes
    acceptanceThreshold: 1_000_000 * 1e18,

### With Incentives

```solidity
uint256[] memory decayParams = new uint256[](1)
decayParams[0] = 9e17

uint256[] memory incentiveParams = new uint256[](1)
incentiveParams[0] = 0.12e18 // 12% decay rate for early supporter bonus

ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment({
    owner: daoMultisig,
    underlyingToken: governanceToken,
    acceptanceThreshold: 200_000 * 1e18,

        threshold: 50_000 * 1e18
    }),
    participantRequirements: ParticipantRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,
        minHoldingDuration: 0
    }),
    releaseLockDuration: 0,
    boardOpensAt: 0,
    boardIncentives: BoardIncentives({
        enabled: true,
        curveType: 0,                         // Linear incentive curve
        curveParameters: incentiveParams       // Early supporters get more
    })
})
```

## Deployment Process

```solidity
// 1. Deploy factory (or use existing)
SignalsFactory factory = new SignalsFactory()

// 2. Create board configuration (see examples above)
ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ...

// 3. Deploy board via factory
address boardAddress = factory.create(config)

// 4. Cast to Signals contract
Signals board = Signals(boardAddress)

// 5. Optional: Set board title
board.setTitle("Season 1: Community Initiatives")

// 6. Optional: Set bounties contract
board.setBounties(bountiesAddress)

// 7. Optional: Set incentives pool (BEFORE boardOpensAt)
board.setIncentivesPool(poolAddress)
```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

After deployment, the board owner can configure additional settings:

### Set Board Title

```solidity
function setTitle(string memory _title) external onlyOwner
```

### Update Decay Curve

```solidity
function setDecayCurve(uint256 _type, uint256[] memory _parameters) external onlyOwner
```

**Requirements:**
- Same validation as initialization
- Can be changed at any time

### Set Inactivity Threshold

```solidity
function setInactivityThreshold(uint256 _threshold) external onlyOwner
```

### Set Bounties Contract

```solidity
function setBounties(address _bounties) external onlyOwner
```

### Set Incentives Pool

```solidity
function setIncentivesPool(address _pool) external onlyOwner
```

**Requirements:**
- Can only be called BEFORE `boardOpensAt`
- Must be called if `boardIncentives.enabled == true`
