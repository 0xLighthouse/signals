# Creating a Signals Board

A Signals board can be created around a specific theme or purpose, allowing participants to submit initiatives in line with the chosen objective. The board will have an owner who has additional rights and responsibilities to administer the board. It is possible for a DAO to enact ownership functions as the result of a DAO vote, enabling decentralized and permissionless operation of the board.

The board is first deployed via the `SignalsFactory` contract, and additional configurations can be applied later. 

## Factory Deployment

Boards are created through the `SignalsFactory` contract:

```solidity
function create(ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment calldata config)
    external
    payable
    returns (address)
```

### Returns

- `address` - The deployed Signals board contract address

### Event Emitted

```solidity
event BoardCreated(address indexed board, address indexed owner)
```

## Configuration Structure

The complete configuration is defined in the `FactoryDeployment` struct:

```solidity
struct FactoryDeployment {
    address owner;                                      // Board owner address
    address underlyingToken;                           // ERC20 token address
    uint256 acceptanceThreshold;                       // Weight needed for acceptance
    uint256 lockInterval;                              // Time unit for locks (seconds)
    uint256 maxLockIntervals;                          // Max lock duration in intervals
    uint256 proposalCap;                               // Max active proposals
    uint256 decayCurveType;                           // 0=linear, 1=exponential
    uint256[] decayCurveParameters;                    // Curve params (must be length 1)
    ProposerRequirements proposerRequirements;         // Who can propose
    ParticipantRequirements participantRequirements;   // Who can support
    uint256 releaseLockDuration;                       // Timelock after acceptance
    uint256 boardOpenAt;                              // Unix timestamp for opening
    BoardIncentives boardIncentives;                   // Reward configuration
}
```

## Deployment Process

```solidity
// 1. Deploy factory (or use existing)
SignalsFactory factory = new SignalsFactory()

// 2. Create board configuration (see examples above)
ISignalsFactory.FactoryDeployment memory config = ...

// 3. Deploy board via factory
address boardAddress = factory.create(config)

// 4. Cast to Signals contract
Signals board = Signals(boardAddress)

// 5. Optional: Set board title
board.setTitle("Season 1: Community Initiatives")

// 6. Optional: Set bounties contract
board.setBounties(bountiesAddress)

// 7. Optional: Set incentives pool (BEFORE boardOpenAt)
board.setIncentivesPool(poolAddress, incentivesConfig)
```
