# Closing a Signals Board

Board closure is a **permanent, owner-only action** that immediately releases all locked tokens and prevents any future activity on the board.

## To Do: Add "Cancel" and "Close" Function

Closing a board should leave locks intact, cancelling the board should release everything immediately.


## Board States

Boards have only two possible states:

```solidity
enum BoardState {
    Open,    // Board accepting proposals and support
    Closed   // Board permanently closed, all locks withdrawable
}
```

## Closing a Board

### Function Signature

```solidity
function closeBoard() external onlyOwner
```

### Access Control

**Only the board owner** can close a board. This function uses OpenZeppelin's `onlyOwner` modifier.

### Event Emitted

```solidity
event BoardClosed(address indexed actor)
```

The `actor` parameter contains the address that called `closeBoard()` (for now, only the owner).

## Current Effects of Closing a Board

Board closure is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE. 

### 1. All Token Locks Become Immediately Withdrawable

Closing a board **bypasses all withdrawal restrictions**, so all locks become immediately withdrawable.

### 2. No New Proposals Allowed

### 3. No New Support Allowed

### 4. Existing Initiatives Remain Unchanged

Closing the board **does not change initiative states**:

- Proposed initiatives stay Proposed
- Accepted initiatives stay Accepted
- Expired initiatives stay Expired

The closure only affects the ability to interact with the board and withdraw tokens.

## Token Redemption After Closure

Users redeem tokens using the standard `redeem()` function:

```solidity
function redeem(uint256 tokenId) public nonReentrant
```
