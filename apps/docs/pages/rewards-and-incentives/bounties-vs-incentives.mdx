# Bounties vs. Incentives

The Signals protocol offers two distinct reward mechanisms: **Bounties** (initiative-specific, externally funded) and **Incentives** (board-wide, DAO-funded). Understanding the difference is crucial for both board creators and participants.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Bounties | Incentives |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Scope** | Per-initiative | Board-wide |
| **Who funds** | Anyone (external contributors) | DAO/Board owner |
| **When added** | Anytime before acceptance | Before board opens |
| **Token types** | Multiple ERC20s (whitelisted) | Single ERC20 (reward token) |
| **Distribution** | On initiative acceptance | On initiative acceptance |
| **Reward basis** | Proportional to lock amount | Time-weighted (early supporters favored) |
| **Configuration** | Per-bounty expiration | Board-level pool |
| **Claiming** | Manual (when implemented) | Auto-claimed on redemption |
| **Contract** | `Bounties.sol` | `IncentivesPool.sol` |

## Bounties: Initiative-Specific External Rewards

Bounties are externally funded rewards attached to specific initiatives, allowing anyone to incentivize particular proposals.

### Key Characteristics

**1. Initiative-Specific**
- Each bounty is attached to exactly one initiative
- Contributors choose which initiatives to fund
- Multiple bounties can be added to the same initiative
- Bounties stay with the initiative regardless of outcome

**2. Externally Funded**
- Anyone can add a bounty (not just board owner)
- Contributors provide their own ERC20 tokens
- No central pool - distributed funding model
- Tokens transferred immediately when bounty added

**3. Multi-Token Support**
- Support for any whitelisted ERC20 token
- TokenRegistry manages whitelist
- Can mix USDC, DAI, custom tokens, etc.
- Each token distributed separately

**4. Configurable Splits**
- Three-way distribution on acceptance:
  - Protocol fee (e.g., 5%)
  - Supporter rewards (e.g., 20%)
  - Treasury allocation (e.g., 75%)
- Splits configurable by bounties owner
- Versioned to prevent retroactive changes

**5. Proportional Distribution**
- Supporter share based on locked amount
- Formula: `supporterShare = (lockedAmount / totalLocked) * voterAmount`
- All supporters treated equally regardless of timing
- No time-weighting applied

### How Bounties Work

#### Adding a Bounty

```solidity
// Anyone can add a bounty
IERC20(usdcToken).approve(address(bounties), 10_000e6)

bounties.addBounty(
    initiativeId,                   // Which initiative
    address(usdcToken),             // Which token
    10_000e6,                       // Amount
    block.timestamp + 30 days,      // Optional expiration
    IBounties.Conditions.NONE       // Terms
)
```

#### Distribution on Acceptance

When the initiative is accepted:

```solidity
// Automatic call from Signals contract
bounties.handleInitiativeAccepted(initiativeId)

// Internal distribution
totalBounty = 10,000 USDC
protocolFee = 10,000 * 5% = 500 USDC
voterPool = 10,000 * 20% = 2,000 USDC
treasury = 10,000 * 75% = 7,500 USDC

// Each supporter gets proportional share
supporter1Share = (50k / 200k) * 2,000 = 500 USDC
supporter2Share = (100k / 200k) * 2,000 = 1,000 USDC
supporter3Share = (50k / 200k) * 2,000 = 500 USDC
```

### Bounties Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- üéØ **Specific feature requests** - Fund implementation of particular features
- üí∞ **External sponsorships** - Companies funding relevant proposals
- üèÜ **Competition prizes** - Reward best proposals in a category
- ü§ù **Community contributions** - Anyone can boost proposals they care about
- üìä **Focused incentivization** - Target specific outcomes

**Example scenarios:**
- Protocol wants dark mode ‚Üí Add 5,000 USDC bounty to dark mode initiative
- DAO member wants specific integration ‚Üí Add tokens to that proposal
- Multiple parties interested ‚Üí Each adds their own bounty

## Incentives: Board-Wide Time-Weighted Rewards

Incentives are DAO-funded reward pools that incentivize early support across all initiatives on a board, with time-weighted distribution favoring early participants.

### Key Characteristics

**1. Board-Wide Pool**
- Single pool for entire board (not per-initiative)
- Funds all accepted initiatives from one source
- Pre-funded before board opens
- Maximum reward per initiative configured

**2. DAO-Funded**
- Board owner/DAO provides funding
- Centralized reward pool
- Controlled distribution via IncentivesPool contract
- Budget set at board creation time

**3. Single Reward Token**
- One ERC20 token for all rewards
- Typically DAO governance token
- Consistent reward denomination
- Simplified accounting

**4. Time-Weighted Distribution**
- **Early supporters get MORE rewards**
- Based on lock creation time relative to board opening
- Uses linear decay curve from board open to acceptance
- Incentivizes early signaling

**5. Automatic Claiming**
- Rewards auto-claimed on redemption
- No separate claim transaction needed
- Calculated when initiative accepted
- Gas-efficient for supporters

### How Incentives Work

#### Time-Weighted Calculation

```solidity
// Formula for time-weighted rewards
weight(supporter) = lockAmount * (1 - k * t)

// Where:
// t = (lockCreationTime - boardOpensAt) / (acceptanceTime - boardOpensAt)
// k = decay rate parameter (e.g., 0.12)
// t ranges from 0 (locked at board open) to 1 (locked at acceptance)
```

**Example:** Board opens Day 0, initiative accepted Day 10, k=0.12

```
Alice locks 100 tokens on Day 0:
  t = 0/10 = 0.0
  weight = 100 * (1 - 0.12 * 0.0) = 100.0

Bob locks 100 tokens on Day 5:
  t = 5/10 = 0.5
  weight = 100 * (1 - 0.12 * 0.5) = 94.0

Charlie locks 100 tokens on Day 9:
  t = 9/10 = 0.9
  weight = 100 * (1 - 0.12 * 0.9) = 89.2

Total weight = 283.2

If pool allocates 1,000 tokens to initiative:
  Alice: (100.0 / 283.2) * 1,000 = 353.1 tokens
  Bob: (94.0 / 283.2) * 1,000 = 331.9 tokens
  Charlie: (89.2 / 283.2) * 1,000 = 315.0 tokens
```

#### Distribution on Acceptance

When initiative accepted:

```solidity
// Automatic calculation
incentivesPool.calculateIncentives(
    initiativeId,
    boardOpensAt,
    acceptanceTimestamp
)

// Rewards auto-claimed when supporter redeems
signals.redeem(tokenId)
// ‚Üí Automatically claims all incentive rewards
```

### Incentives Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- **Early signaling incentives** - Reward those who identify good proposals first
- **Board-wide participation** - Encourage activity across all initiatives
- **First-mover advantage** - Create urgency to support early
- **Quality discovery** - Reward scouts who find good proposals
- **Momentum building** - Kickstart initiative support with rewards

**Example scenarios:**
- DAO wants active Season 1 ‚Üí Fund 1M token incentives pool
- Encourage early evaluation ‚Üí Use high decay rate (k=0.2)
- Reward initiative scouts ‚Üí Early supporters get 2x rewards
- Bootstrap new board ‚Üí Large pool attracts early participation

---

### Reward Calculation

**Bounties:**
```solidity
// Simple proportional split
supporterReward = (supporterLocked / totalLocked) * voterPoolAmount

// Example:
// Supporter locked 50k out of 200k total
// Voter pool = 2,000 USDC
// Reward = (50k / 200k) * 2,000 = 500 USDC
```

**Incentives:**
```solidity
// Time-weighted calculation
timeWeight = lockAmount * (1 - decayRate * timeFactor)
supporterReward = (supporterWeight / totalWeight) * poolAllocation

// Example:
// Early supporter: 100 tokens, t=0.1 ‚Üí weight = 98.8
// Late supporter: 100 tokens, t=0.9 ‚Üí weight = 89.2
// Early gets ~10% more rewards for same lock
```

### Token Management

**Bounties:**
- Multiple token types (USDC, DAI, custom tokens)
- Whitelisting via TokenRegistry
- Each contributor chooses token
- Complex tracking (mixed denominations)
- Separate claims per token

**Incentives:**
- Single reward token (typically DAO token)
- Simple accounting
- Auto-claimed on redemption
- Gas efficient
- No token flexibility

### Distribution Control

**Bounties:**
```solidity
// Configured by Bounties contract owner
allocations = [5%, 20%, 75%]  // Protocol, Voters, Treasury
receivers = [protocolAddr, votersAddr, treasuryAddr]

// Versioned - can update but doesn't affect existing bounties
bounties.updateSplits(newAllocations, newReceivers)
```

**Incentives:**
```solidity
// Board configuration at creation time
boardIncentives = BoardIncentives({
    enabled: true,
    curveType: 0,           // Linear decay
    curveParameters: [0.12e18]  // 12% decay rate
})

// Cannot change after board opens
```

### Timing Constraints

**Bounties:**
- Add anytime before acceptance
- Optional expiration per bounty
- Expired bounties excluded from distribution
- Flexible contribution timing

**Incentives:**
- Must set up BEFORE board opens
- Cannot add to pool after opening
- Fixed pool size for board lifetime
- Requires upfront commitment

### Claiming Process

**Bounties:**
```solidity
// Manual claiming (when implemented)
// After initiative accepted:
bounties.claimRewards(tokenAddress)  // Per token
bounties.claimRewards(usdcAddress)   // Claim USDC
bounties.claimRewards(daiAddress)    // Claim DAI
```

**Incentives:**
```solidity
// Auto-claimed on redemption
// No separate transaction needed:
signals.redeem(tokenId)
// ‚Üí Burns NFT
// ‚Üí Returns locked tokens
// ‚Üí Automatically claims ALL incentive rewards
```

---

## Can You Use Both?

**Yes!** Bounties and Incentives work together:

```solidity
// Board configured with incentives
BoardIncentives({
    enabled: true,
    curveType: 0,
    curveParameters: [0.12e18]
})

// Anyone can still add bounties
bounties.addBounty(initiativeId, usdcToken, amount, expiry, terms)

// On acceptance, supporter gets:
// 1. Their locked tokens back
// 2. Time-weighted incentive rewards (auto-claimed)
// 3. Proportional bounty rewards (manual claim)
```
