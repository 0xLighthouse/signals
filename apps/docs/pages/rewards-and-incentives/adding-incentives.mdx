# Adding Incentives to a Board

Incentives are board-wide reward pools that incentivize early support across all initiatives. They use time-weighted distribution to reward supporters who identify and back promising proposals early.

## Overview

The incentives system:
- Rewards early supporters with more tokens
- Funded by DAO/board owner upfront
- Distributed across all accepted initiatives
- Auto-claimed when supporters redeem locks
- Non-blocking (doesn't prevent acceptance if depleted)

## Prerequisites

Before adding incentives:

1. **Deploy your Signals board** via SignalsFactory
2. **Have reward tokens** ready (typically DAO governance token)
3. **Configure board with incentives enabled** during deployment
4. **Set up BEFORE board opens** - cannot add after `boardOpenAt`

## Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Enable Incentives During Board Creation

When deploying your board through the SignalsFactory, configure the `BoardIncentives` struct with `enabled: true`. If you set this to false, you cannot add incentives later.

Choose your incentive curve type and parameters:
- **Curve Type 0:** Linear decay (currently the only implemented option)
- **Curve Parameters:** Decay rate (e.g., `0.12e18` = 12% decay)

### Step 2: Deploy IncentivesPool Contract

Deploy a new IncentivesPool contract. This contract manages:
- Reward token storage
- Distribution calculations
- Board approvals
- Reward claiming

### Step 3: Initialize the Pool with Funds

Initialize the pool with your reward token and funding parameters:
- **Reward Token:** Typically your DAO's governance token
- **Total Pool Amount:** Total tokens available for rewards (e.g., 1M tokens)
- **Max Per Initiative:** Maximum tokens allocated per initiative (e.g., 10k tokens)

The total pool amount is transferred immediately to the pool and shared across all accepted initiatives on the board.

### Step 4: Approve the Board

The pool must explicitly approve which boards can use it. This is a security feature that prevents unauthorized boards from accessing the pool.

### Step 5: Link Pool to Board

Finally, connect the pool to your board using `setIncentivesPool()`.

**Critical timing:** This must be called before the `boardOpenAt` timestamp. Once the board opens, you cannot change the incentives pool.

For detailed code examples and function signatures, see the [Incentives Configuration Reference](/reference/incentives-configuration).

## Incentive Configuration

### Decay Curve: How Early Support is Rewarded

The decay curve determines how early supporter bonuses are calculated. The `curveType` and `curveParameters` control this behavior.

#### Linear Decay (Type 0)

Currently, only linear decay is implemented. With linear decay:
- Early supporters (at board open) get maximum weight
- Weight gradually decreases as time passes
- Late supporters (near acceptance) get minimum weight
- The decay parameter `k` controls how steep this decline is

**Formula:** `weight = lockAmount * (1 - k * t)`

Where `t` ranges from 0 (locked at board open) to 1 (locked at acceptance).

#### Choosing Decay Rate

The decay parameter `k` controls how much early supporters are rewarded:

| Decay Rate | Early Bonus | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `0.05e18` (5%) | Low | Reward all supporters fairly equally |
| `0.12e18` (12%) | Medium | Standard early supporter advantage |
| `0.20e18` (20%) | High | Strong incentive to evaluate early |
| `0.30e18` (30%) | Very High | Maximum urgency for early support |

**Recommendation:** Start with 0.12 (12%) for balanced incentives.

### Pool Sizing Guidelines

**Total Pool Amount:**
```
Conservative: 1-2% of circulating supply
Moderate: 2-5% of circulating supply
Aggressive: 5-10% of circulating supply
```

**Max Per Initiative:**
```
Typical formula: totalPool / (expected initiatives * 2)
Example: 1M total / (50 expected * 2) = 10k per initiative
```

This allows approximately 50 initiatives with buffer for multiple acceptances.

## How Incentives Are Distributed

### Automatic Calculation on Acceptance

When the board owner accepts an initiative, the IncentivesPool automatically:
1. Fetches all supporters and their locks
2. Calculates time-weighted weight for each supporter
3. Allocates rewards proportionally
4. Caps allocation at `maxRewardPerInitiative`
5. Stores individual allocations

If the pool runs out of funds or calculation fails, **initiative acceptance still succeeds**. The system is non-blocking by design.

### Time-Weighted Calculation

Each supporter's reward is based on:
- **Lock amount:** How many tokens they locked
- **Lock timing:** When they locked relative to board opening and acceptance
- **Decay curve:** The configured decay rate

Early supporters get higher weight for the same lock amount, resulting in more rewards.

See the [Incentives Configuration Reference](/reference/incentives-configuration#time-weighted-calculation) for detailed formulas and examples.

### Automatic Claiming

Rewards are automatically claimed when supporters redeem their lock positions. Benefits:
- No separate claim transaction needed
- Gas efficient
- Automatic for all supporters
- Idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

## Pool Depletion Handling

### Non-Blocking Design

If the pool runs out of funds, initiative acceptance is NOT blocked. The system continues to function normally, but later initiatives may receive reduced or no incentive rewards.

### Monitoring Pool Balance

Check the pool's remaining balance and configuration to track available rewards. This helps you understand how many more initiatives can be incentivized.

### Refilling Strategy

If your pool runs low, you have two options:

**Option 1: Accept It**
- Let the pool deplete naturally
- Later initiatives get fewer/no rewards
- Maintains fair distribution to early participants

**Option 2: Deploy New Board**
- Create a new board with a fresh pool
- "Season 2" with new budget
- Clean slate for participants

**Note:** You cannot add more funds to an existing pool mid-season.

## Best Practices

### Sizing the Pool

1. **Estimate initiative volume**
   - Conservative: 20-50 initiatives
   - Moderate: 50-100 initiatives
   - Aggressive: 100+ initiatives

2. **Set appropriate max per initiative**
   ```
   maxPerInitiative = totalPool / (estimatedInitiatives * safetyFactor)
   safetyFactor = 2-3x for buffer
   ```

3. **Consider token value**
   - High value token: smaller pool
   - Low value token: larger pool
   - Target meaningful rewards per initiative

### Decay Rate Selection

**Conservative (5-8%):**
- Small difference between early/late supporters
- Focus on participation over timing
- Good for mature communities

**Standard (10-15%):**
- Noticeable early advantage
- Balanced incentive structure
- Recommended starting point

**Aggressive (20-30%):**
- Strong early mover advantage
- Creates urgency to evaluate proposals
- Good for new boards needing momentum

### Testing Strategy

Before mainnet deployment:
1. Deploy with small pool on testnet (e.g., 1,000 tokens)
2. Test full lifecycle:
   - Create initiatives
   - Add support at different times
   - Accept initiatives
   - Redeem and verify rewards
3. Verify calculations match expectations
4. Test pool depletion scenarios

### Communication

**Before Launch:**
- Announce total pool size
- Explain decay mechanics
- Set expectations for rewards
- Provide examples of early vs. late support rewards

**During Season:**
- Show remaining pool balance
- Highlight incentive opportunities
- Display time factor for pending initiatives
- Show projected rewards

**After Acceptance:**
- Announce rewards distributed
- Show individual allocations
- Remind about auto-claiming on redemption

## Combining with Bounties

Incentives and bounties work together! Your board can have:
- **Incentives:** Board-wide, time-weighted DAO token rewards
- **Bounties:** Initiative-specific, externally funded multi-token rewards

When an initiative with both is accepted, supporters receive:
1. Their locked tokens back
2. Time-weighted incentive rewards (auto-claimed)
3. Proportional bounty rewards (claimed separately)

See [Bounties vs. Incentives](/rewards-and-incentives/bounties-vs-incentives) for a detailed comparison.

## Validation & Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Cannot set pool | Board already opened | Must set before `boardOpenAt` |
| Cannot enable incentives | Board created with `enabled: false` | Cannot add to existing board |
| Pool not approved | Forgot to call `approveBoard()` | Approve the board in the pool |
| Insufficient balance | Not enough tokens | Approve more tokens before initialization |

## Advanced: Multiple Boards, One Pool

A single IncentivesPool can serve multiple boards, allowing you to share a budget across multiple governance rounds or seasons. Each board must be individually approved by the pool.

**Use case:** Multi-season governance with shared budget.
