# Adding Bounties to Initiatives

Bounties allow anyone to contribute external ERC20 token rewards to specific initiatives. When an initiative is accepted, bounties are automatically distributed according to configurable splits between protocol fees, supporter rewards, and treasury.

## Overview

The Bounties system enables:
- External funding of initiatives with whitelisted ERC20 tokens
- Automatic distribution on initiative acceptance
- Configurable three-way splits (protocol/supporters/treasury)
- Multiple bounties per initiative
- Optional expiration timestamps

**Key Difference from Incentives:** Bounties are externally funded and initiative-specific, while Incentives are board-wide and DAO-funded.

## Adding a Bounty

To add a bounty to an initiative, you need to:

1. **Ensure the token is whitelisted** in the TokenRegistry
2. **Approve the Bounties contract** to spend your tokens
3. **Call addBounty** with the initiative ID, token address, amount, expiration, and conditions

For detailed function signatures and parameters, see the [Initiative Interactions Reference](/reference/initiative-interactions#adding-bounties).

### Requirements

- Token must be whitelisted in TokenRegistry
- Initiative must exist
- Caller must have sufficient balance
- Caller must approve Bounties contract
- Tokens are transferred immediately upon adding

## Token Whitelisting

Only whitelisted tokens can be used for bounties. Board owners or token managers add tokens to the whitelist through the TokenRegistry contract. The registry validates that tokens are ERC20 compliant before adding them.

Check if a token is whitelisted before attempting to add a bounty.

## Distribution Mechanics

### When Bounties Are Distributed

Bounties are automatically distributed when the board owner accepts an initiative. The Signals contract notifies the Bounties contract, which calculates and allocates rewards according to the configured split percentages.

### Distribution Formula

Each bounty token type is split into three portions:
- Protocol fees (e.g., 5%)
- Supporter rewards (e.g., 20%)
- Treasury allocation (e.g., 75%)

**Note:** Percentages are configured per board and must sum to 100.

### Supporter Share Calculation

Each supporter's share of the voter pool is proportional to their locked amount relative to the total locked in the initiative.

## Bounty Expiration

Bounties can have an optional expiration timestamp. If set:
- Expired bounties are excluded from distribution
- They no longer count toward the initiative's total bounty pool
- Future versions may include refund mechanisms for expired bounties

Set `expiresAt` to 0 for bounties that never expire.

## Claiming Bounty Rewards

### Current Status

**Important:** Claim/withdrawal functions are **not yet implemented** in the contract.

**Current behavior:**
- Distribution happens automatically on acceptance
- Balances are tracked in the contract
- No withdrawal function to claim rewards yet
- Funds accumulate but cannot be withdrawn

Future implementations will allow supporters to claim their allocated bounty rewards after an initiative is accepted.

## Configuration & Versioning

Board owners can update the distribution split percentages using the `updateSplits` function. When splits are updated:
- A new configuration version is created
- Existing bounties use their original version's splits
- New bounties use the current version
- This prevents retroactive changes to existing commitments

Allocations must always sum to 100 when updating splits.

## Complete Example Flow

Here's the typical flow for adding and distributing bounties:

1. **Deploy Bounties system** - Owner deploys TokenRegistry and Bounties contracts with initial split configuration
2. **Whitelist tokens** - Token manager adds approved ERC20 tokens to the registry
3. **Contributor adds bounty** - External contributor approves tokens and calls addBounty
4. **Initiative gets accepted** - Board owner accepts the initiative
5. **Bounties distributed** - Protocol fees, supporter rewards, and treasury allocations are calculated and tracked
6. **Supporters claim** - (Future) Supporters withdraw their allocated rewards

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Whitelist token first** - Ensure token is in TokenRegistry before contributing
2. **Set reasonable expiration** - Give initiative time to gain support
3. **Diversify tokens** - Consider multiple token types for broad appeal
4. **Monitor initiative** - Track progress toward acceptance

### For Board Owners

1. **Configure fair splits** - Balance protocol sustainability and supporter incentives
2. **Whitelist carefully** - Only add trusted, liquid tokens
3. **Update splits thoughtfully** - Use versioning to prevent retroactive changes
4. **Communicate changes** - Inform community of configuration updates

### Security Considerations

1. **Token whitelisting** prevents malicious tokens
2. **Immediate transfer** on addBounty secures funds
3. **Versioned splits** prevent retroactive changes
4. **ReentrancyGuard** protects distribution
5. **SafeERC20** ensures safe token transfers

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

**Current Limitations:**
1. No claim/withdrawal function - Rewards accumulate but can't be claimed
2. No refund mechanism - Expired bounties can't be reclaimed by contributors
3. Mixed token denominations in preview - Estimates combine different tokens
4. No storage optimization - Expired bounties remain in storage

**Planned Features:**
- Implement reward claiming for supporters
- Implement refund logic for expired bounties
- Event-driven pattern for Signals integration
- Gas optimization for large bounty lists
