# Add Support to an Initiative

Supporting an initiative allows community members to lock tokens to signal their backing for a proposed idea. Support is represented by an ERC721 NFT that can be redeemed once the initiative is accepted or expired.

## Overview

When you support an initiative, you:
1. Lock ERC20 tokens for a specified duration
2. Receive an ERC721 NFT representing your lock position
3. Contribute weight toward the initiative's acceptance threshold
4. Become eligible for incentive rewards (if configured)

## How to Support

To support an initiative, call `supportInitiative()` with:
- The initiative ID you want to support
- The amount of tokens to lock (in wei)
- The lock duration (measured in intervals, not seconds)

You'll receive an NFT token ID representing your lock position.

See the [Initiative Interactions Reference](/reference/initiative-interactions#supporting-initiatives) for detailed function signatures and parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before supporting an initiative, ensure:

1. **Board is open** - Current time ≥ `boardOpensAt` and board state is Open
2. **Initiative exists and is in Proposed state** - Cannot support accepted or expired initiatives
3. **You meet participant requirements** - Check eligibility with `canParticipate(address)`
4. **You have sufficient tokens and approval** - Balance ≥ amount and approved the Signals contract

## Token Approval

You must approve the Signals contract to spend your tokens before calling `supportInitiative`. The contract will transfer your tokens when you lock them.

## Participant Eligibility

Boards configure three types of participant requirements:

### 1. None (Most Permissive)

Anyone can participate - just need tokens to lock.

### 2. Minimum Balance

Participants must hold a minimum token balance at support time. This prevents low-balance sybil attacks.

### 3. Minimum Balance and Duration (Most Restrictive)

Participants must:
- Currently hold ≥ `minBalance` tokens
- Have held ≥ `minBalance` for ≥ `minHoldingDuration` blocks
- Token must support ERC20Votes (checkpoint functionality)

This ensures only committed token holders can participate.

## Weight Contribution

Your support contributes weight toward the initiative's acceptance threshold. Weight is calculated based on:
- Lock amount
- Lock duration
- Time decay (based on board's decay curve)

### Initial Weight

Your initial weight = amount × lockDuration

For example:
- Lock 100 tokens for 10 intervals
- Initial weight = 100 × 10 = 1,000

### Weight Decay

Weight decays over time based on the board's decay curve:

**Linear Decay:** Weight decreases steadily over time
**Exponential Decay:** Weight decreases at an accelerating rate

Weight never drops below the nominal lock amount until the lock expires.

## NFT Lock Position

When you support an initiative, you receive an ERC721 NFT representing your lock position.

### NFT Properties

- **Name:** `{underlyingToken.name()} Locked Support`
- **Symbol:** `sx{underlyingToken.symbol()}`
- **Transferable:** Yes - you can trade your lock position
- **Redeemable:** Holder can redeem underlying tokens after acceptance/expiration

The NFT contains all lock details including amount, duration, and creation timestamp.

## Multiple Lock Positions

You can support the same initiative multiple times with different amounts and durations. Each support creates a **separate NFT** with independent:
- Lock duration
- Amount
- Creation timestamp
- Decay calculation

## Redemption

You cannot withdraw tokens early. Redemption is only available when:

1. **Initiative is Accepted**
   - Must wait for `releaseLockDuration` to pass (if configured)
   - Auto-claims incentive rewards on redemption

2. **Initiative is Expired**
   - Immediate redemption available
   - No incentive rewards

3. **Board is Closed**
   - Emergency override - all locks become immediately redeemable
   - Bypasses release timelock

See the [Reclaiming Locked Tokens](/initiatives/reclaim-tokens) guide for redemption details.

## Integration with Incentives

If the board has incentives enabled:

- **Early supporters get more rewards** - Time-weighted based on when you lock
- **Rewards are calculated on acceptance** - Based on your weight contribution
- **Auto-claimed on redemption** - No need to manually claim
- **Multiple locks are weighted independently** - Each position earns rewards

You can preview potential rewards before acceptance using the IncentivesPool contract.

## Best Practices

### Lock Duration Strategy

- **Longer locks = higher initial weight** but decay to zero
- **Shorter locks = lower initial weight** but less decay risk
- Consider initiative momentum and time to acceptance

### Amount Strategy

- **Larger amounts** contribute more weight toward threshold
- **Multiple smaller locks** provide flexibility for different durations
- Balance between conviction and liquidity needs

### Timing

- **Early support** earns more incentive rewards (if configured)
- **Wait for momentum** if unsure about initiative viability
- Check `lastActivity` timestamp to gauge recent support

### Risk Management

- Only support initiatives you believe will be accepted
- Remember tokens are locked until acceptance or expiration (60+ days default)
- Consider board's `releaseLockDuration` for exit timeline
- NFTs are tradable if you need early liquidity
