# Tracking Initiative Support

The Signals protocol provides comprehensive view functions to query initiative support data, including current weight, historical weight, supporters, and individual lock positions.

## Overview

You can track initiative support through several types of queries:

1. **Initiative data** - Get basic information about the initiative
2. **Weight tracking** - Query current and historical weight
3. **Lock positions** - View individual lock details
4. **Supporter lists** - See who is supporting an initiative
5. **Position enumeration** - List NFT positions by owner

## Key Concepts

### Weight vs. Token Amount

- **Token Amount:** The raw number of tokens locked in an initiative
- **Weight:** The voting power those tokens contribute, which decays over time based on lock duration and elapsed time

Weight determines when an initiative reaches the acceptance threshold.

### Current vs. Historical Queries

Many query functions accept a timestamp parameter:
- **Current:** Use `getWeight(initiativeId)` for weight at the current block
- **Historical:** Use `getWeightAt(initiativeId, timestamp)` for weight at a specific time

Historical queries are useful for creating charts and verifying past data.

## Common Query Patterns

### Check Initiative Progress

To see how close an initiative is to acceptance:
1. Get the current weight using `getWeight()`
2. Get the acceptance threshold
3. Calculate progress percentage

### View Your Positions

To see all your lock positions:
1. Use `listPositions(yourAddress)` to get all NFT token IDs you own
2. For each token ID, use `getTokenLock(tokenId)` to get lock details
3. Check which initiatives you're supporting

### Monitor Supporter Activity

To track an initiative's support:
1. Use `getSupporters(initiativeId)` to get all unique supporters
2. Use `getPositionsForInitiative(initiativeId)` to get all lock positions
3. Calculate aggregate statistics (total locked, average duration, etc.)

## Weight Decay

Weight decays over time based on the board's configuration:

- **Linear Decay:** Weight decreases steadily
- **Exponential Decay:** Weight decreases at an accelerating rate

Query functions automatically account for decay when calculating weight. The weight you see reflects the current voting power, not the original locked amount.

## Events for Real-Time Tracking

For real-time updates, monitor these events:

- `InitiativeProposed` - New initiative created
- `InitiativeSupported` - Someone locked tokens
- `InitiativeAccepted` - Owner accepted the initiative
- `InitiativeExpired` - Initiative expired due to inactivity
- `Redeemed` - Someone redeemed their lock position
- `Transfer` - NFT position was transferred

## Using the Indexer

For efficient querying and historical data, consider using the indexer API (if available). The indexer provides:
- Aggregated initiative data with weight/supporters
- Historical weight snapshots
- Lock position details
- Event history

Querying the indexer is faster and more cost-effective than making multiple contract calls.

## Best Practices

1. **Use historical queries for charts** - Call `getWeightAt()` with past timestamps
2. **Cache static data** - Board configuration doesn't change frequently
3. **Index events off-chain** - Don't query events directly from the contract
4. **Batch read calls** - Use multicall for multiple queries
5. **Use indexer when available** - Faster than direct contract queries
