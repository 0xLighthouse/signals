# Reclaiming Locked Tokens

When you support an initiative by locking tokens, you receive an ERC721 NFT representing your lock position. Once the initiative is accepted or expired, you can redeem this NFT to reclaim your locked tokens (plus any rewards).

## When Can You Redeem?

Your locks become redeemable when the initiative reaches a terminal state:

### Accepted Initiatives

If the initiative is **accepted** by the board owner:
- Wait for the `releaseLockDuration` to pass (if configured)
- If `releaseLockDuration = 0`, redeem immediately
- If `releaseLockDuration > 0` (e.g., 7 days), wait until `acceptanceTimestamp + releaseLockDuration`

### Expired Initiatives

If the initiative is **expired** by the board owner:
- Redeem immediately - no waiting period

### Board Closure (Emergency)

If the **board is closed** by the owner:
- All locks become immediately redeemable regardless of initiative state
- Release timelock is bypassed

## What You Receive

When you redeem, you get:

**From Accepted Initiatives:**
- ✅ Your original locked tokens
- ✅ Incentive rewards (automatically claimed if configured)
- ✅ Bounty rewards available to claim separately

**From Expired Initiatives:**
- ✅ Your original locked tokens only
- ❌ No incentive rewards
- ❌ No bounty rewards

## How to Redeem

### Check Redemption Status

Before attempting to redeem, check that:
1. The initiative is in Accepted or Expired state
2. For Accepted initiatives, the release timelock has passed
3. Your lock position hasn't already been redeemed
4. You own the NFT representing the lock position

You can use the `getTokenLock()` and `getInitiative()` functions to query this information.

### Redeem Your Position

Call the `redeem()` function with your NFT token ID. The function will:
1. Validate the lock hasn't been redeemed
2. Verify you own the NFT
3. Check the initiative state and timelock
4. Mark the lock as withdrawn
5. Burn the NFT
6. Transfer your locked tokens back
7. Auto-claim any incentive rewards

See the [Initiative Interactions Reference](/reference/initiative-interactions#redeeming-locks) for detailed function signatures.

### Find Your Token IDs

Use `listPositions(address)` to get all your lock NFT token IDs, or `getLocksForSupporter(address)` to find locks you've created.

## Multiple Positions on Same Initiative

If you locked tokens multiple times on the same initiative:
- Each lock has its own NFT token ID
- Redeem each position separately
- Incentive rewards (if any) are claimed on first redemption
- Subsequent redemptions just return locked tokens

## What Happens During Redemption

The redemption process:
1. Validates the lock exists and hasn't been redeemed
2. Verifies you own the NFT
3. Checks the initiative is in a redeemable state (Accepted or Expired)
4. Validates any release timelock has passed (for Accepted)
5. Marks the lock as withdrawn
6. Burns the NFT
7. Transfers locked tokens back to you
8. Auto-claims incentive rewards (for Accepted initiatives only)

## Claiming Bounty Rewards

Incentive rewards are automatically claimed during redemption, but bounty rewards must be claimed separately from the Bounties contract.

**Note:** The bounty claiming function is defined but not yet implemented in the current version.

## Best Practices

1. **Check before redeeming** - Verify the initiative is in a redeemable state
2. **Wait for full timelock** - Don't attempt to redeem before release time
3. **Track your positions** - Use query functions to see all your locks
4. **Monitor initiative state** - Watch for acceptance or expiration events
5. **Redeem promptly** - Claim rewards while the incentive pool still has funds

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Accepted Initiative with Timelock
1. Initiative is accepted by board owner
2. Wait for `releaseLockDuration` to pass
3. Call `redeem()` to receive tokens + incentive rewards
4. Claim bounty rewards separately (if configured)

### Scenario 2: Expired Initiative
1. Initiative expires due to inactivity
2. Call `redeem()` immediately (no waiting)
3. Receive your original locked tokens only

### Scenario 3: Board Closed
1. Board owner closes the board
2. All locks become immediately redeemable
3. Call `redeem()` to receive tokens (+ rewards if accepted)
