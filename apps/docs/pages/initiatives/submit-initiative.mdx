# Submit an Initiative

Initiatives are proposals submitted to a Signals board that allow community members to signal support by locking tokens. Anyone who meets the board's proposer requirements can create an initiative.

## Overview

There are two ways to create an initiative:

1. **Propose only** - Create the initiative without locking tokens
2. **Propose with lock** - Create the initiative and immediately lock tokens to show support

## Prerequisites

Before submitting an initiative, ensure:

- The board is open (current time ≥ `boardOpenAt`)
- You meet the board's proposer requirements
- You have sufficient token balance and approval (if locking tokens)

You can check if you're eligible to propose using the `canPropose(address)` view function.

## Creating an Initiative

### Basic Proposal

The simplest way to create an initiative is using `proposeInitiative`. You provide a title, detailed description (markdown supported), and optionally supply attachment metadata. This creates the initiative without locking any tokens.

See the [Initiative Interactions Reference](/reference/initiative-interactions#proposing-initiatives) for function signatures and parameters.

### Proposal with Lock

To immediately show support for your initiative, use `proposeInitiativeWithLock`. In addition to the title, description, and optional attachments, you specify an amount of tokens to lock and a lock duration (measured in intervals).

This creates the initiative and your first lock position in a single transaction.

## Attachments

Attachments let you include supporting resources such as proposal documents, designs, or forum posts.

- Add up to **5** attachments per initiative
- Each attachment requires a non-empty URI (`https://`, `ipfs://`, or on-chain pointer)
- MIME type and description fields are optional hints for clients
- Pass an empty array if you do not need attachments

## Duration and Intervals

Lock duration is measured in **intervals**, not seconds:
- Intervals are defined per board using the `lockInterval` parameter (typically 1 day)
- Example: If `lockInterval = 1 day` and you specify duration `7`, tokens are locked for 7 days
- Maximum duration is limited by the board's `maxLockIntervals` setting

## Proposer Eligibility

Boards can configure three types of proposer requirements:

### 1. None (Most Permissive)

Anyone can propose if they have enough tokens to meet the threshold. When proposing with lock, those tokens get locked.

### 2. Minimum Balance

Proposers must hold a minimum balance **plus** the threshold amount. This prevents low-balance accounts from creating proposals.

### 3. Minimum Balance and Duration (Most Restrictive)

Proposers must:
- Currently hold ≥ `minBalance` tokens
- Have held ≥ `minBalance` for ≥ `minHoldingDuration` blocks
- Have ≥ `threshold` tokens to lock
- Use a token that supports ERC20Votes (checkpoint functionality)

This ensures only committed token holders can create proposals.

## Token Approval

When locking tokens (using `proposeInitiativeWithLock`), you must first approve the Signals contract to spend your tokens. Without approval, the transaction will fail.

## Initiative States

Once created, your initiative starts in the **Proposed** state and can transition to:

- **Accepted** - Board owner accepted the initiative
- **Expired** - No activity for more than the inactivity timeout (default 60 days)

Note: The Cancelled state is reserved for future use and not currently implemented.

## Weight and Decay

When tokens are locked in support of an initiative, they contribute **weight** that decays over time:

- Initial weight is based on the locked amount and duration
- Weight decays according to the board's decay curve (Linear or Exponential)
- Weight becomes 0 after the lock duration passes
- An initiative is typically accepted when its weight reaches the acceptance threshold

The board owner has discretion to accept initiatives regardless of whether they've reached the threshold.

## Board Configuration Impact

These board parameters affect initiative creation:

- `proposalCap` - Maximum active proposals per user
- `acceptanceThreshold` - Weight needed for typical acceptance
- `maxLockIntervals` - Maximum lock duration allowed
- `lockInterval` - Duration of one interval
- `proposerRequirements` - Eligibility criteria for proposers
- `boardOpenAt` - Timestamp when board opens for proposals
- `activityTimeout` - Inactivity period before expiration

## Best Practices

### Writing Proposals

1. **Clear title** - Concise and descriptive
2. **Detailed description** - Explain the problem, proposed solution, and expected outcomes
3. **Use markdown** - Format your proposal for readability
4. **Be specific** - Provide actionable details

### Lock Strategy When Proposing

1. **Signal commitment** - Lock tokens to show you believe in your proposal
2. **Choose appropriate duration** - Balance between weight contribution and lock time
3. **Consider incentives** - Early supporters often earn more rewards

### Eligibility

1. **Check requirements first** - Use `canPropose()` before attempting to create
2. **Ensure sufficient balance** - Account for both threshold and minimum balance requirements
3. **Hold tokens long enough** - For duration-based requirements, wait before proposing
