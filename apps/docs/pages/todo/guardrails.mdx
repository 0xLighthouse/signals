## Guardrails

 guard against common risks.

### JIT Profit Extraction

1. Attacker sees profitable bond incoming via mempool
2. Front-runs by wrapping large amount OP → vOP
3. Bond purchase happens, profit distributed across all vOP holders
4. Attacker immediately unwraps vOP → OP, capturing profit
5. LP who provided long-term liquidity gets diluted returns

:::warning

### Liquidity Drain

Syntetic token is trading below 1:1 parity on external markets

1. Arbitrageur buys cheap vTKN (e.g., 0.95 vTKN each)
2. Unwraps vTKN for full 1:1 TKN value
3. 5% instant profit extracted from LP reserves
4. Repeat until pool drained

::::

:::warning

### Fee Structure for Non-LP Operations

```
If allowing public wrap/unwrap:
- Wrap fee: 0.5% (discourages profit extraction)
- Unwrap fee: 1% (protects against arbitrage)
- Fees go to LP rewards pool
```

::::

:::warning

### Time Delays

```
- Wrap to unwrap delay: 24 hours minimum
- Prevents MEV sandwich attacks
- Forces commitment to LP position
```

External market scenario:

- vOP trades at $1.40 on vOP/USDC (below $1.50 fair value)
- Attacker buys 50k vOP for $70k
- Unwraps internally for 50k OP = $150k
- $80k profit extracted from pool
