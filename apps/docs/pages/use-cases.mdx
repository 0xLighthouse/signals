# Use Cases

Boards can be configured in various ways, depending on the needs of the community.

## Examples

### Open Community Board

This board could be used to expose priorities from the community to set the direction of product development or funding priorities. The board could be left open long term, to allow evolving ideas to rise and fall organically. Users are allowed to lock tokens for a long period of time.

### Time-limited Project Board

This board could be used to identify popular ideas during a short duration, with the results being used for some other follow-up purpose. It could be set to close after one week, after which no new ideas can be proposed. If users are very passionate about an issue they can lock up their tokens for a long time, but those tokens will remain locked after the board closes. Tokens for accepted initaitives are not released until after the board is closed, so there is no incentive for users to support something that is just about to pass, with intent to support something else immediately after.

| Max Lock Duration | 6 months |
| Decay Strength | Medium |
