# Use Cases

Explain some ways of using the protocol here.

## Examples

### Open Community Board

This board could be used to gather feedback from the community on a new product or feature. The board could be left open long term, to allow evolving ideas to rise and fall organically. Users are allowed to lock tokens for a long period of time.

```solidity
BoardConfig({
    version: "1.0",
    owner: msg.sender,
    underlyingToken: address(token),
    acceptanceThreshold: 100_000 * 1e18,
    maxLockIntervals: 365,
    proposalCap: 10,
    lockInterval: 1 days,
    decayCurveType: 0,
    decayCurveParameters: [9e17], // 0.9 linear decay
    proposerRequirements: ProposerRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,
        minHoldingDuration: 0,
        threshold: 1000 * 1e18
    }),
    participantRequirements: ParticipantRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.None,
        minBalance: 0,
        minHoldingDuration: 0
    }),
    releaseLockDuration: 0  // Immediate release
})
```

### Time-limited Project Board

This board could be used to identify popular ideas during a short duration. It could be set to close after one week, after which no new ideas can be proposed. If users are very passionate about an issue they can lock up their tokens for a long time, but those tokens will remain locked after the board closes. Tokens for accepted initaitives are not released until after the board is closed, so there is no incentive for users to support something that is just about to pass, with intent to support something else immediately after.

```solidity
BoardConfig({
    version: "1.0",
    owner: msg.sender,
    underlyingToken: address(governanceToken),
    acceptanceThreshold: 500_000 * 1e18,
    maxLockIntervals: 180,
    proposalCap: 5,
    lockInterval: 1 days,
    decayCurveType: 0,
    decayCurveParameters: [11e17], // 1.1 linear decay
    proposerRequirements: ProposerRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalanceAndDuration,
        minBalance: 100_000 * 1e18,
        minHoldingDuration: 50400,  // ~7 days
        threshold: 50_000 * 1e18
    }),
    participantRequirements: ParticipantRequirements({
        eligibilityType: EligibilityType.MinBalance,
        minBalance: 10_000 * 1e18,
        minHoldingDuration: 0
    }),
    releaseLockDuration: 7 days  // 7-day cooling-off period
})
```
