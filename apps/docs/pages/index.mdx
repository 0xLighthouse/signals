# Signals Protocol

Community-driven initiative governance with token-weighted voting.

::::steps

### Initiative Proposers

Create and propose initiatives to your community. Lock tokens to demonstrate commitment and gather support from other token holders.

### Token Holders

Support initiatives by locking your tokens for a specified duration. Your locked tokens generate voting weight that decays over time, creating dynamic, time-weighted governance.

### Board Administrators

Configure proposal requirements, acceptance thresholds, and decay curves to match your community's governance needs. Set parameters at initialization for immutable, transparent rules.

## Core Features

- **Token-Weighted Voting**: Support initiatives by locking tokens for custom durations
- **Decay Curves**: Vote weight decays over time (linear or exponential)
- **Transferable Positions**: Lock positions are represented as ERC721 NFTs
- **Configurable Requirements**: Set minimum balances and holding durations for proposers
- **Initiative Lifecycle**: Proposed → Accepted/Expired → Redeemable
