# Bonds

Harbor considers a bond to be any [Non-Fungible Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-721) that represents ownership of locked tokens that will become unlocked in the future (also called a vesting NTF, etc). Bonds are only accepted from whitelisted issuers to ensure that all bonds in the system will work correctly. All bonds must either implement the `IHarbor.sol` interface, or utilize an adapter which presents the required information in the correct format.

```solidity
interface IHarbor is IERC721Enumerable {
    /**
     * @notice Reference data postion needed to calculate offers.
     *
     * @param underlying Address of the underlying token 
     * @param faceValue Face value of the bond
     * @param duration Total duration of the lock in seconds
     * @param created Timestamp of when the lock was created
     * @param maturity Timestamp of when the lock matures
     * @param redeemed Flag indicating whether the locked tokens have been redeemed
     */
    struct ReferenceData {
        address underlying;
        uint256 faceValue;
        uint256 duration;
        uint256 created;
        uint256 maturity;
        bool redeemed;
    }
}
```
