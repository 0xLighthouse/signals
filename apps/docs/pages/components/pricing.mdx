# Pricing

When a `Harbor market` is presented with a bond to buy or sell, it makes use of an on-chain pricing algorithm which generates a quote based on the attributes of the bond, such as the amount of tokens locked up in the bond, the time to maturity, the issuer, and/or other attributes.

Let:

- $$P_b(t)$$: the buy price of the bond at time $$t$$
- $$P_s(t)$$: the sell price at time $$t$$
- $$V$$: the face value (redemption value) of the bond at maturity $$T$$
- $$P(t)$$: the market price function returned by the pricing algorithm

Then, to guarantee profitability and arbitrage safety, the pricing algorithm should satisfy:

<p>
```math
P_b(t) < P_s(t) < V \quad \forall t < T
```
</p>

Additionally, prices must not decrease over time:

<p>
$$
\frac{dP(t)}{dt} \geq 0
$$
</p>

If a bond is purchased but not resold, the maximum profit is realized at redemption:

<p>
$$
\Pi(t) = V - P_b(t)
$$
</p>

> where $$\Pi(t)$$ is the profit if the bond is held to maturity.

Consider the following Linear strategy.
