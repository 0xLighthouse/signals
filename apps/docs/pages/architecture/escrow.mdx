### Escrow Contract

The Escrow Contract manages the tokenized representations of both collateral and bonds. It ensures proper collateralization of `hTokens` through a combination of open wrapping/unwrapping functions and access-controlled minting and burning. It also facilitates settlement and redemption workflows through integration with the Harbor market contract (hook).

### Key Responsibilities

* Token Wrapping: Convert underlying collateral into wrapped forms (e.g., UNI â†’ hUNI) and back
* Bond Collateralization: Lock and release bond NFTs as collateral
* Access Control: Only `market` contracts can deposit and withdraw bond NFTs
* (Planned): Manage redemption and settlement of matured bond positions

### Core Functions

```solidity
interface IEscrow is ERC20 {
    // Corresponding token
    address public immutable underlying;

    // Public: wrapping/unwrapping collateral
    function wrapToken(uint256 amount) external;
    function unwrapToken(uint256 amount) external;

    // Role-restricted: bond management
    function depositBond(address issuer, uint256 tokenId, address from) external;
    function withdrawBond(address issuer, uint256 tokenId, address to) external;

    // TODO:
    function redeemBond(address issuer, uint256 tokenId) internal;
}
```
