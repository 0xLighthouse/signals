# Bond Pricing with Stylus

## Overview

This repository implements an advanced bond pricing engine using Arbitrum Stylus. By leveraging Stylus's enhanced computational capabilities, we've created complex bond pricing mechanisms that would be prohibitively expensive or impossible to implement in standard Solidity.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a fully compatible IBondPricing contract on Arbitrum Stylus
- Seamless integration with v4 hooks on Arbitrum for dynamic bid/ask pricing
- Advanced mathematical models for bond valuation that leverage Stylus's efficient compute
- Gas-optimized algorithms for on-chain bond pricing calculations

## Why Stylus?

Stylus enables complex financial calculations on-chain by providing:

- Higher computational throughput than standard EVM
- More efficient execution of mathematical operations
- Support for Rust's performance and safety guarantees
- Cost-effective complex calculations that would be gas-prohibitive in Solidity
