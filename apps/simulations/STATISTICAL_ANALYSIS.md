# Statistical Analysis Framework for Signals Governance

This document describes the comprehensive statistical analysis framework designed to rigorously test and validate the Signals governance system across different token distributions and parameter configurations.

## Overview

The statistical analysis framework provides tools to scientifically evaluate governance system performance with a focus on four key attributes:

1. **Capturing voter preference intensity** - How well the system allows users to express varying levels of preference
2. **Opportunity cost as sufficient risk** - Whether token locking creates meaningful economic commitment
3. **Locking mechanisms improving sybil resistance** - How well the system prevents sybil attacks through economic barriers
4. **Empowering smaller voting blocks increases inclusivity** - Whether smaller token holders can have meaningful influence

### Key Classes

- **`ExperimentRunner`** - Orchestrates large-scale parameter sweeps with parallel execution
- **`GovernanceMetrics`** - Calculates comprehensive governance quality metrics
- **`TokenDistributionGenerator`** - Creates various wealth distribution scenarios
- **`StatisticalTests`** - Performs significance testing and confidence intervals

## Governance Metrics

### 1. Voter Preference Intensity Metrics

**Purpose**: Measure how well the system captures varying levels of user preference intensity.

**Key Metrics**:

- `preference_intensity_score` - Composite score combining amount and duration variation
- `support_amount_cv` - Coefficient of variation in support amounts
- `lock_duration_cv` - Coefficient of variation in lock durations
- `weight_variance` - Variance in calculated weights (amount × duration)
- `weight_gini` - Gini coefficient of weight distribution

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate better preference intensity capture. Users should be able to express strong preferences through larger amounts and longer lock periods.

### 2. Opportunity Cost Metrics

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether token locking creates sufficient economic risk to prevent frivolous participation.

**Key Metrics**:

- `opportunity_cost_score` - Composite score (participation_rate × avg_lock_ratio)
- `avg_user_lock_ratio` - Average fraction of tokens locked per user
- `avg_locked_token_ratio` - Average fraction of total supply locked
- `user_lock_ratio_variance` - Variance in individual user lock ratios

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more effective opportunity cost mechanisms. The system should require meaningful token commitment while maintaining participation.

### 3. Sybil Resistance Metrics

**Purpose**: Measure how well locking mechanisms prevent sybil attacks through economic barriers.

**Key Metrics**:

- `sybil_resistance_score` - Composite score (lock_requirement × (1 - correlation_penalty))
- `holdings_influence_correlation` - Correlation between token holdings and governance influence
- `influence_gini` - Gini coefficient of governance influence distribution
- `holdings_gini` - Gini coefficient of token holdings distribution

**Interpretation**: Higher sybil resistance scores indicate better protection. Lower correlation between holdings and influence (when combined with locking requirements) suggests the system is harder to game.

### 4. Inclusivity Metrics

**Purpose**: Assess how well the system empowers smaller voting blocks to have meaningful influence.

**Key Metrics**:

- `inclusivity_score` - Composite score combining participation and influence components
- `small_holder_participation` - Participation rate of bottom 50% token holders
- `small_holder_influence` - Fraction of total influence held by small holders
- `successful_small_initiatives` - Success rate of initiatives from small holders

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate better inclusivity. Small holders should be able to participate meaningfully and have proportional influence when they coordinate.

## Token Distribution Testing

### Distribution Types

The framework tests governance across various wealth inequality scenarios:

1. **Equal Distribution** - Baseline with equal token allocation
2. **Pareto Distributions** - Power law distributions with varying inequality levels
3. **Custom Distributions** - Specific concentration ratios (e.g., "10% control 75%")
4. **Normal Distributions** - Gaussian distributions with different variances
5. **Bimodal Distributions** - Two distinct wealth classes

### Distribution Analysis

Each distribution is characterized by:

- Gini coefficient (inequality measure)
- Percentile concentration ratios (top 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%)
- Mean, median, and variance of holdings
- Bottom 50% share of tokens

## Experimental Design

### Parameter Sweeps

The framework supports multi-dimensional parameter sweeps across:

```python
parameter_sweeps = {
    "acceptance_threshold": [1000, 5000, 10000, 25000],
    "decay_multiplier": [0.90, 0.95, 0.98],
    "prob_create_initiative": [0.05, 0.10, 0.15],
    "prob_support_initiative": [0.15, 0.25, 0.35],
    "max_support_tokens_fraction": [0.3, 0.5, 0.8],
}
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation

- Multiple runs per configuration for statistical significance
- Configurable confidence levels (default 95%)
- Parallel execution for performance
- Reproducible results with seed control

### Statistical Analysis

- **Hypothesis Testing** - Mann-Whitney U, t-tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
- **Effect Size Calculation** - Cohen's d for practical significance
- **Confidence Intervals** - Bootstrap and parametric methods
- **Multiple Comparison Correction** - Bonferroni and FDR control

## Usage Examples

### Quick Demo

```python
from statistical_analysis.experiment_runner import ExperimentRunner, ExperimentConfig

# Create experiment configuration
config = ExperimentConfig(
    name="governance_test",
    description="Test governance across distributions",
    parameter_sweeps={
        "acceptance_threshold": [1000, 5000],
        "decay_multiplier": [0.90, 0.95],
    },
    token_distributions=[
        {"type": "equal", "description": "Equal distribution"},
        {"type": "pareto", "alpha": 1.16, "description": "Pareto 80/20"},
    ],
    num_monte_carlo_runs=30,
    num_epochs=50,
    num_users=100,
)

# Run experiment
runner = ExperimentRunner(config)
results_df = runner.run_experiments()

# Analyze results
successful_runs = results_df[results_df['success'] == True]
print(f"Success rate: {len(successful_runs)/len(results_df):.1%}")
```

### Comprehensive Analysis

```python
from statistical_analysis.experiment_runner import create_governance_experiment

# Create comprehensive experiment
config = create_governance_experiment()
runner = ExperimentRunner(config)

# Run full analysis (may take hours)
results_df = runner.run_experiments()

# Results automatically saved to experiments/ directory
# - CSV file with all metrics
# - Configuration file
# - Raw simulation data (optional)
```

## Interpreting Results

### Governance Quality Assessment

1. **High-performing configurations** show:
   - High preference intensity scores (>0.5)
   - Meaningful opportunity cost (lock ratios >0.3)
   - Good sybil resistance (low holdings-influence correlation)
   - Strong inclusivity (small holder participation >0.4)

2. **Distribution robustness** is indicated by:
   - Consistent performance across different wealth distributions
   - Statistical significance in key metrics
   - Reasonable confidence intervals

3. **Parameter sensitivity** analysis reveals:
   - Which parameters most affect governance quality
   - Optimal parameter ranges for different objectives
   - Trade-offs between different governance attributes

### Statistical Significance

- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant difference
- **Effect size > 0.5**: Practically meaningful difference
- **Confidence intervals**: Range of likely true values
- **Multiple comparisons**: Adjusted p-values for family-wise error control

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability

- **Parallel execution** - Utilizes multiple CPU cores
- **Memory management** - Configurable raw data storage
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time execution monitoring
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure recovery

### Computational Requirements

## Conclusion

This statistical analysis framework provides the rigorous, scientific foundation needed to validate governance system design choices. By systematically testing across different token distributions and parameter configurations, we can build confidence that the Signals governance system achieves its intended properties of capturing preference intensity, creating sufficient opportunity costs, resisting sybil attacks, and empowering inclusive participation.

The framework's comprehensive metrics, robust experimental design, and statistical rigor enable evidence-based governance system development and provide the foundation for peer-reviewed research and community confidence in the system's democratic properties.
